<h3 id="Abstract">Abstract</h3>
This paper explains the well known probability puzzle known as the Monty Hall problem, named asfter Monty Hall, an Americal host of the gameshow 'Let's make a deal'. This problem is very famous due to its paradoxical nature as it goes against inital assumptions. Furthermore, in this paper we analyse and explain the assumptions and proof of the unexpected claim made by Marilyn Vos Savant using Bayes' theorem, comparing the likelihood of winning based on the  contestants initial desicion and wether they keep or stick with their original choice. Therefore, revealing that switching doors once one door with an unwanted prize is revealed the probability of winning is systematically increased. This concludes that the Monty Hall problem produces an excellent example of the difference between intuitive reasoning and mathematical desicion making.
</p>

<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
  <p id="Introduction_InText">
  The Monty hall problem is one of the most famous counter-intuitive statistics problems ever. It was named after Monty Hall, an american gameshow host mostly known for the show ‘Let’s make a deal’, which was aired from the 1960s to the 80s. The premise of this show was that contestants choose from three doors whilst dressed up in silly costumes, behind these doors were one desirable prize (cash) and the others had undesirable prizes (a donkey). 
  </p>
<h3 id="Analysis">Analysis and discussion</h3>
  <div id="Analysis_InText">
<p>
The women behind the proof of the monty hall problem was Marilyn vos Savant. She held the title of “worlds highest IQ” from Guinness world records between the years 1985 to 1989. This title was given to her based on a IQ test called the Stanford–Binet test, which she took when she around 10 years of age where she managed to score 228. However, the Guinness world records deemed IQ tests to be unreliable to determine a single record holder and they decided the retire the category of “highest IQ” altogether. This was due to the idea that measuring extremely high IQ’s was deemed as very difficult and unreliable to verify fairly.
</p>
<p>
She was proposed the question ‘Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three doors: behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats.  You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the other doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, ”Do you want to pick door No. 2?”’ Is it to your advantage to take the switch?’ In the Q and A section of a magazine called parade. She replied a published an answer that stated that switching would double your chances so it’s an advantage to switch. This was met with many academics disproving of this result (92% of the general public opposed this answer and 62% of universities disagreed). 
</p>
<p>
The idea behind this problem is that a participant enters a gameshow where there is three doors where each door has a prize behind it. One of the doors has a prize (Cash) and the other two doors have something undesirable behind them (in the ‘lets make a deal’ show they used to have live animals behind the doors e.g donkeys). The participant  is then asked to choose one of the three doors. After the door is selected the gameshow host will open one of the doors that were not selected an reveal a door that had the no so good prize behind it. Then the participant is asked whether they want to stick with their original choice or switch to the other option. The monty hall problem states that the probability of getting the better prize is higher when the participant switches at this point rather than sticking with their original decision. 
</p>
<p>
However there are  assumptions behind this. Firstly, the gamehost will always open a door and reveal what is behind it before asking the contestant if they would like to switch their door selection. Secondly, the door the participant has chosen is never immediately revealed (This is essential for the proof to work). Thirdly, the game host never opens the good prize door first. Fourthly, the main prize is equally likely to be behind any of the doors. 
</p>
<p>
There is many ways to mathematically prove this. One way is using Bayes’ theorem, which states:
<img src="Bayes'_Thoerem.png" alt="Bayes'Theorem">
This is equal to the probability of the contestant winning given that they stick with their initial choice.
</p>
<p>
If one door contained the grand prize, cash prize (CP), and the other two doors contained goats (G), Initially P(choosing CP) = ⅓ and P(choosing G) = ⅔.
<img src="Monty_Hall_Problem.png" alt="Bayes'Theorem">
This is equal to the probability of winning given that the contestant switched from their initial choice.  This is because there is a total probability of 1 and 1 - ⅓ is equal to ⅔ . Therefore, The probability that the cash prize is behind door number 1 given that the host opens door number 3 is equal to the probability of the host opeing door number 3 given that the cash prize is behind door number 1 times by the probability of the cash prize being beind door number 1 divided by the probability that the host opens door number 3.
For this example the contestant has chosen door number 1. Using this information to assign the conditional probability the values are: P(host opens door number 3| CP is behind door number 1) = ½, P(host opens door number 3| CP is behind door 2) = 1 and P(host opens door number 3| CP is behind door number 3) = 0. 
Therefore, P(CP behind door number 1| host opens door number 3 = 1/2 x 1/3 ÷ 1/2 = 2/3
This prooves that switching doors increases the contestants probability of winning from one-third to two-thirds, demonstrating how probability theory can reveal outcomes that contradict human intuition.

However, this can also be shown via a computer generated simulation of the game. Below is the data that I generated from the simulation:

        ['stuck with original choice', 23, 72],
        ['Changed from original choide', 66, 34],
      ]);

      var materialOptions = {

      var materialChart = new google.charts.Bar(document.getElementById('chart_div'));
